FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which base pairs or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data.
We can extract each sequence from the FASTA files in Python with the help of a library by writing a few line of codes. This code extracts data by using these sequences by inputting them in four different websites automatically and parallely and will store them in a simple csv file for analysing.
